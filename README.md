> an animation glitch in that file is being tracked down.

## Preview page

`index.html` — dark-theme portfolio page:

- **Hero** — full-width interactive radial menu (bonus lesson, 2000×1000)
- **Real Work** — a section for production pieces outside the course
  (currently: the `AVQ_logo/avq_interactivelogo.riv` dotted-logo animation).
  The surrounding copy/colors are a pixel-accurate mockup of an Avanquest
  Figma design ("PDF SDK, API & Web SDK.") used to preview the logo in context
  for a manager review — swap in real copy and the site's own theme tokens
  (`--bg`, `--card`, `--text`, `--muted`) once that's done.
- **Gallery** — masonry grid of lesson cards; hover a card for a description
  and an interaction hint. Cards mount lazily (`IntersectionObserver`, see
  `JS/rive.js`) so the browser isn't juggling 15+ WebGL2 contexts at once.
- Rive runtime: `@rive-app/webgl2` (required — some blend-mode effects are
  ignored by the Canvas2D renderer)

## Stack
